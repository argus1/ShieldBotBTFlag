This is a route following robot used to simulate movement disorders.  The robot used is a differential-drive robot controlled with an arduino board connected to a motor and sensor shield.  The code reads IR sensor data to detect a line and adjust the course while passing flags by bluetooth to a monitor on laptop or smartphone.
